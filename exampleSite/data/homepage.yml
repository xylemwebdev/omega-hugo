  title: Our Only Requirement
  content: "At Xylem, we believe in the creative power of the unrestrained imagination.
    That’s why our only true requirement for submissions to the magazine is that your
    original creative work is shareable with the great wide world out there. \n\nOf
    course, send us poetry, short stories, creative nonfiction and photography. But
    how about screenplays, word art, prose-poetry, one-act plays, photographed sculpture,
    songs, puns, paintings, slam poetry, etchings, memoirs, fairy tales, cartoons,
    journal entries, interviews, limericks, anime, flash fiction, exquisite corpses,
    collages, or blackout poetry? We want Xylem to reflect the expansiveness of the
    artistic mind."
